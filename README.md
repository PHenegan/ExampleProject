ExampleProject
This project is made up of a group of primarily static classes that are used to provide examples of Java code for people that are new to it. Each class encompasses a certain aspect of Java, such as if-else statements, loops, objects, etc.
This project will be used by me as a guide to help new members of the Montclair Robotics (555) learn to code on a basic level. It is intended to be used as a reference if a member doesn't understand a certain part of Java.

The static classes are divided to individually teach a certain aspect of coding, such as loops, if-else statements, objects and OOP, etc.
